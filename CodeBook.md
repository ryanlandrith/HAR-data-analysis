###The following information described the remaining variables in the processed data:

In addition to the variables obtained from inertial measurement unit data, two variables have been introduced to 
identify the activity type and subject. The original set of variables are described below and have been subsetted to include only the mean and standard deviation for each variable. Further, the data is summarized as only the mean of each remaining variable per each unique activity/subject combination.

The variables are normalized to the range of [-1,1] and therefore do not have meaningful units;however, it is assumed that the original measurements were: gyroscope rotational velocity 
 in (degrees/second), accelerations in (G), and that jerk is the derivative of the respective measurement 
with respect to time. (i.e. tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ is in degrees/second^2).

###New variables
-subject
-activity (one of the following: WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, SITTING
, STANDING
, LAYING
)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

-tBodyAcc-XYZ
-tGravityAcc-XYZ
-tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
-tBodyGyro-XYZ
-tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
-tBodyAccMag
-tGravityAccMag
-tBodyAccJerkMag
-tBodyGyroMag
-tBodyGyroJerkMag
-fBodyAcc-XYZ
-fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
-fBodyGyro-XYZ
-fBodyAccMag
-fBodyAccJerkMag
-fBodyGyroMag
-fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

-mean(): Mean value
-std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

-gravityMean
-tBodyAccMean
-tBodyAccJerkMean
-tBodyGyroMean
-tBodyGyroJerkMean
